This project is a neural network-based casino application that simulates casino games using artificial intelligence. The application leverages machine learning techniques to model and predict outcomes, providing an interactive and educational experience for users interested in the intersection of AI and gaming.

Features
Neural Network Simulation: Implements neural networks to simulate casino game outcomes, offering insights into probabilistic modeling.

Interactive Notebooks: Includes Jupyter Notebooks (nural.ipynb and pyth.ipynb) that demonstrate the training and evaluation of neural network models in the context of casino games.

TCP Communication: tcp.py script showcases how to establish TCP connections, potentially for multiplayer interactions or client-server architectures.

Repository Structure
nural.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook illustrating the development and training of a neural network model for simulating casino games.

pyth.ipynb: Supplementary notebook that may contain additional experiments or alternative modeling approaches.

tcp.py: Python script demonstrating TCP socket programming, which can be used to facilitate communication between different components or users in the application.

README.md: This file, providing an overview and guidance for the project.
